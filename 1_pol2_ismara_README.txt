System requirements
-------------------

Running of script requires R. It can be downloaded from one of the many Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) mirror websites of the R Project for Statistical Computing. 

https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html

The script was tested with R version 3.4.1 on a Darwin operating system supporting 64-bit x86-64 variant of the Intel x86 processors. 

It took ~25 sec to complete execution of the R script in its current state (i.e. without uncommenting "DiffBind" part) from the command line (see below).


Running R script
----------------

This script can be run from the command line:
R CMD batch 1_pol2_ismara.R


or with R studio or the R GUI:
source("1_pol2_ismara.R")


Expected output
---------------

This script quantifies the DNA motif enrichment in early RNAPII-engaged cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). 

The following files will be produced upon run execution.

:: pol2_ismara_homer_motif_ARSA.pdf (Figure 1e, Supplementary Figure 1b)
Left: Clustered heatmap of DNA motif Z-scores generated by ISMARA over time from stage 6 to 12.
Right: Co-clustered heatmap of the significance of DNA motif enrichment before MBT and at MBT or after. :: pol2_CRM_spearman.pdf (requires additional input files as outlined in the first paragraph of the script and uncommenting final part of the script) (Figure 1d)
Spearman correlation heatmap of DNA occupancies at CRMs:: pol2_homer_peakVsBgd.pdf (Supplementary Figure 1b)Bubble plot showing the occurrence of DNA motifs in RNAPII-engaged CRMs versus background before MBT and at MBT or after.
